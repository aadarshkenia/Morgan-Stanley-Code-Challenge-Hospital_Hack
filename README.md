We are a collection of computer science students who met at HackRU IX. Inspired by the New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital challenge, our mission was to create this website to enable patients to find and interact with those who have similar backgrounds and experiences.

Patients who are unable to physically interact with others due to limited mobility may find it difficult to develop sustained, meaningful relationships, especially with others like them. This website is intended to help extend the reach of these patients beyond their hospital room or building to connect with patients across the country. While helping patients, we found it important to stop the stigma associated with certail mental illnesses. This led to the implementation of ARTICLES - a compilation of personal stories of patients. We provide a platform to patients for sharing their stories, attempting to increase overall health literacy and empathy for such patients.
