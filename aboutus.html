  <h2><font color="white">About Us</font></h2>

  <p><font color="white">We are a collection of computer science students who met at HackRU IX.
  Inspired by the New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital
  challenge, our mission was to create this website to enable patients to find and interact
  with those who have similar backgrounds and experiences. Patients who are
  unable to physically interact with others due to limited mobility may find
  it difficult to develop sustained, meaningful relationships, especially with
  others like them. This website is intended to help extend the reach of these
  patients beyond their hospital room or building to connect with patients
  across the country. We hope that you find this website useful.</font></p>

  <h2><font color="white">Patient Stories - An innovative platform!</font></h2>
  <p><font color="white">While helping patients, we found it important
  to stop the stigma associated with certail mental illnesses. This led to the implementation of ARTICLES - 
  a compilation of personal stories of patients. We provide a platform to patients for sharing their stories, 
  attempting to increase overall health literacy and empathy for such patients.</font></p>

  <br>
  <h2><font color="white">How It Works</font></h2>

  <p><font color="white">Sign in to our website and create a profile to let others know what your
  background is like. You can choose what health topics you are interested in
  talking about and we will connect you with other patients. For example, if you
  select "eating disorders" as a topic, we will connect you with other patients
  who have also selected "eating disorders." You can use our website to
  interact with other patients who similar experiences and are dealing with
  similar issues.</font></p>

  <br>
  <h2><font color="white">Why Use Our Website</font></h2>

  <p><font color="white">It can be difficult staying in the hospital for extended durations, and we
  think that one of the best ways to make your stay more pleasant is talking
  to people who are going through similar experiences. We can help you instantly
  find others with similar experiences who also want to interact through our
  online platform. You can create and respond to posts on our messaging platform,
  and you can also continue the conversation by sending an email through our
  website to other users.</font></p>
